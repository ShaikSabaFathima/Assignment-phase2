    <h2> Tags and Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not. There is a subtle difference
        between HTML elements and tags that many people aren't aware of.

        HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should display content to the user. A
        tag starts with a bracket and ends with a> bracket. Most tags exist in pairs in HTML. Tags have an opening and
        closing part. They are similar, except the closing part has a / sign after the opening bracket.</p>
